Project Overview
----------------
The AquaSense Prediction Project aims to develop a web-based application that utilizes machine learning
to predict the quality of water based on various physical and chemical parameters such as pH, temperature,
turbidity, dissolved oxygen, and conductivity. The application is hosted on Vultr Cloud to ensure 
scalability and accessibility.

Features
--------
- User-friendly web interface for inputting water quality parameters.
- Predictions based on machine learning models trained on historical data.
- Integration of simulated sensor data, manual prediction, and sensor prediction for real-time predictions.
- Deployment on Vultr Cloud for reliable performance and accessibility.

Technologies Used
-----------------
- Backend: Flask (Python)
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Machine Learning: Scikit-learn
- Database: MySQL / PostgreSQL (choose based on your implementation)
- Cloud Infrastructure: Vultr Cloud

Installation Instructions
-------------------------
1. **Clone the repository:**

2. **Set up a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):

3. **Install required packages:**

4. **Set up the database** (if applicable):
- Create a database and configure the connection in the application.

Build and Deployment Instructions
---------------------------------
1. **Prepare the Environment:**
- Ensure that you have Python, Flask, and any required database setup in your environment.

2. **Database Configuration:**
- Configure your database connection settings in your application (e.g., in a config file or environment variables).

3. **Build the Application:**
- Run any necessary migrations or setup scripts to prepare your database for use.
- Make sure your machine learning model is trained and ready for predictions.

4. **Deploy to Vultr Cloud:**

- **Create a Vultr instance:**
  - Log in to your Vultr account and create a new instance with your preferred specifications (OS, region, etc.).

- **Set up the server:**
  - SSH into your Vultr instance:
    ```
    ssh user@your-vultr-ip
    ```
  - Install necessary packages (Python, Flask, etc.) on your instance.

- **Clone the repository on the Vultr instance:**
  ```
  git clone <repository-url>
  cd water_quality_prediction
  ```

- **Install required packages on the server:**
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

- **Run the Flask application:**
  ```
  python app.py
  ```

5. **Access your application:**
- Open a web browser and navigate to `http://your-vultr-ip:5000` to access the application.

6. **Configure for Production** (optional but recommended):
- Consider using a production-ready server like Gunicorn or uWSGI to serve your Flask application.
- Set up a reverse proxy with Nginx or Apache for better performance and security.

Usage
-----
1. **Run the Flask application:**

2. **Open your web browser and navigate to:**

3. **Input the required parameters** in the web form and click "Predict" to get the water quality predictions.

4. Use the "Simulate Sensor Data" button to generate automated predictions based on simulated sensor inputs,
manual prediction, and sensor prediction.

Architecture
------------
The architecture of the application consists of the following components:
- **User Interface:** The frontend of the application where users input data.
- **Web Server:** The Flask backend that processes requests and communicates with the machine learning model.
- **Machine Learning Model:** Predicts water quality based on input parameters.
- **Database:** Stores historical water quality data.
- **Vultr Cloud:** The hosting environment that ensures scalability and reliability of the application.
